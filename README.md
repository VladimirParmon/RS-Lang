# Welcome to RS-Lang!
It is a final project for RSSchool online frontend courses.

This TypeScript app represents a platform for language learning.

It has a dictionary, personal cabinet, minigames, statistics and more!

## Feel free to have a look [here](https://vladimirparmon.github.io/RS-Lang/index.html)

## UPDATE: Project has been updated to work with mock data instead of an actual server

In 2022 the project's server became unavailable: Heroku became paid only and mongoDB stopped working because of sanctions.

Since it was not my backend (it was provided by the people from RSSchool on voluntary basis) and this is only a learning project I just mocked the data inside the app. The purpose of this app is to showcase that I can make cool responsive apps even without frameworks, to show minigames, cool design, etc...

One can still have a decent look, it's just no longer calls an actual API.
